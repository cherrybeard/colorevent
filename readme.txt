Do not change deployed files without editing source.

Copy _dev folder to your desktop and run:
# npm install					â€” only first time!
# grunt

Now edit jade, sass and coffee files.

To deploy, copy files from public folder. Rename index.html to index.php (otherwise mail form will not work). You don't need base.html.
